Martini DNA/RNA - 05.06.2017

This package includes files for creating and running systems using Martini DNA/RNA force field.

This package includes the release version of the parameters.


The package contains:
  martini_v2.1-dna.itp      The general force field file with the new smaller 
                            bead types for nucleic acid bases. 
  martini_v2.1P-dna.itp     Force field file for simulations with polarizable
                            water.
  martini_v2.0_ions.itp     The default martini ion parameters.
  martinize-nucleotide.py   A version of martinize.py script for creating 
                            topologies for DNA/RNA molecules. Under development
                            and currently works only when the input file 
                            contains only the DNA/RNA molecule in .gro format.
  em.mdp                    A minimization mdp file, just the default Martini
                            mdp with a shorter time step. 
  equil.mdp                 A equilibration mdp file, just the default Martini
                            mdp with a shorter time step. 
  mdrun.mdp                 A production mdp file, just the default Martini
                            mdp with a shorter time step. 
  dna_backmapping_files/    Files required to backmap DNA/RNA using Backward.py.
  README                    This readme file. 


Please note:

Martinize-nucleotide.py works better with GRO files so convert your PDB files 
using editconf or another program. 

In your .top file the #define RUBBER_BANDS has to be set before you include
an itp file with elastic network in order for that EN to be active.

Martinize-dna.py writes output to stdout, please read that to ensure that
your topology was created successfully. Check espeacially whether the 
DNA strands were recognized correctly (number of strands and lengths).


Usage:

There are four separate topology types that martinize-dna.py can create. 
For simulating single-stranded DNA there are parameters without elastic network. 
For double-straned DNA/RNA there is a weakly restrained model that allows more 
realistic bending of DNA/RNA but still has known issues with the alignment of 
bases and stability when used with a longer time step. A very stiff elastic 
network model is offered as an alternative solution for systems where DNA/RNA 
structure is not expected to change. For structures formed out of single strand 
but with a well defined structure also a stiff elastic network is offered to prevent 
the structure from changing. There is also an option to restrain several strands 
using the same elastic network which can be used as basis for elastic networks 
of more complicated DNA/RNA structures.
